	<h1>Welcome to Tech Twig!</h1>
	<h3>Our Goal</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Develop a mentorship program: Mentorship is a great way to help young engineers develop their skills and get feedback from experienced professionals. You could pair up mentees with mentors who have experience in their areas of interest.</li>
		<li>Encourage open source contributions: Encourage members of your community to contribute to open source projects. This will not only help them develop their skills, but also give them exposure to the broader software engineering community.</li>
		<li>Host hackathons and coding challenges: Hosting hackathons and coding challenges can be a fun way for young engineers to test their skills and compete with their peers. You could also invite companies to sponsor these events, which could provide networking opportunities for your members.</li>
		<li>Provide educational resources: Provide your members with access to educational resources, such as online courses and tutorials, that can help them learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in software engineering.</li>
		<li>Organize networking events: Organize networking events that allow young engineers to meet with professionals from the industry. These events could provide opportunities for members to learn about potential job openings and internships.</li>
